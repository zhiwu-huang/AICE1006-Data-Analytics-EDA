# Python sources for data analytics
A 13-lecture introductory modual on data analytics (processing, visualization, and analysis) with [numpy](https://numpy.org/), 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

<!-- The course consists in 13 lectures which should last about 1 hours each. --> 
The lectures are [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to be presented as slides using the [rise](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or related extension.
Each lecture is accompanied by exercises with solutions.

## Requirements 

A recent installation of Python (>=3.6) with numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, jupyter and rise is required.

* To install all the packages, type in a terminal:

``` 
$ pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib jupyter
$ pip install rise
$ pip install plotly
$ pip install --upgrade notebook==6.4.12 traitlets==5.9.0 jupyter jupyter_contrib_nbextensions (recommended)
```

## Quick start

1.  Open a terminal (e.g., in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)) in the folder where you have downloaded the slides.ipynb
2.  Start jupyter:
```
$ jupyter notebook

or 
$ jupyter lab

or **vs code (recommended)**


```
3. Open the slides with jupyter or VS code/jupyter. 



4. Click on the rise icon to go in presentation mode or use the command below
$ jupyter nbconvert 01_jupyter/01_slides_jupyter.ipynb --to slides --post serve
