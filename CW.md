*AICE1006 Data Analytics*

# AICE1006-Coursework2: EDA Project

Due date: **Friday 16th May 2025, 16:00**.  
[Handin](https://moodle.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=12844)

Required files: report.pdf + notebook code

## Overview
In this coursework, each student will choose an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) problem to investigate. Students are expected to carry out a series of EDA experiments on their selected dataset, drawing on the knowledge acquired from Lectures 4 to 12. The outcomes and insights must be documented in the form of a written conference paper.


## Details

Each student will propose a project, ideally selecting a dataset, either a publicly available dataset or the dataset generated from Coursework1. Please refer to the links at the end of this document for additional inspiration. The project should showcase the student’s ability to apply their learned methods to address a real-world EDA problem—focusing on a descriptive or interpretative task as part of the individual coursework.

### Deliverable 

**A zip file of the final report and the notebook code** must be submitted to Moodle [Handin](https://moodle.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=12844) by **16:00 on Friday, 16th May**.  
  The paper **must** follow the latex template from **[AICE1006_CourseworkII_template](https://github.com/zhiwu-huang/AICE1006-Data-Analytics-EDA/blob/main/CW_template.zip)**. The report should not exceed **8 pages**, excluding all references and appendices (if applicable).  

### Notes
* Students are encouraged to leverage the two "Cousework Q&A" sessions to receive feedback from the lecturer.

* Each student can book time to meet with the lecturer (ideally in the published office hours or the unused lecture slots) should they need additional help or guidance.

#### Learning Outcomes

* Solve real-word problems using learned EDA technqiues (topics illustrated in the Lecture on "[EDA Introduction](https://moodle.ecs.soton.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=122)")
* Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
	- Key concepts, tools and approaches for EDA on real-world data sets
	- Theoretical concepts and the motivations behind different EDA approaches

### Mark Scheme

The final coursework report and jupyter notebook code will be marked as a single piece of work using the following criteria:

Criterion                    | Description                                                                                | Marks
-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------
Introduction of dataset      | Introduce dataset information (Sec.1)                                                      | 10
Application of techniques    | Show ability to apply EDA techniques and analyse results obtained (Secs.2-6 + Code)        | 50
Conclusion/Reflection        | Reflect on you have learned on the dataset and the techniques used (Sec.7)		  | 20
Reporting                    | Clear and professional reporting (Overall)                                                 | 10


Standard ECS late submission penalties apply.

Written feedback will be given covering the above points, and will be emailed out once marking is complete.
